I'm a VP of Engineering at ICF, a VA-based consulting firm. ICF does some really cool "make the world a better place" projects. I work in energy, environment, and transportation, mostly with the Federal government.


I'm interested in a lots of IT and other random things:

* Project management, especially when being agile (not just Agile)
* Web development
* Good design, where web, printed, or physical
* Search, natural language processing, machine learning
* Mobile
* Web services
* Productivity
* Convincing people of good ideas (ie: sales)
* Using simple language in the work place
* Podcasts
* Football (Redskins and all college)
