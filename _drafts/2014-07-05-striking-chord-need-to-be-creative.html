I wrote about one incarnation of them when I saw its <a href="http://www.nerdthoughts.net/2013/10/i-saw-something-awesome-today.html">awesomeness</a>.<br /><br />One sentence in Guy's post really struck a chord with me: "My role as client PM and then development manager left me disconnected from the crafting of code." &nbsp;I have had this same growing feeling ever since I started to move from coding to management early in my career. I've realized that my big motivators at work are to be creative, build, and learn. I remember in college finally deciding on majoring in Computer Science because it was the only engineering discipline that allowed the student to design and build from scratch while still in college. Even in CS101, you were able to build something from nothing. My mechanical and civil engineering friends wouldn't be physically building their own creations for decades.<br /><br />As my career has progressed further and further from coding, I've had to fill that creativity and build void in various ways. As corny as it sounds, building an effective sales pitch in Powerpoint that combines the right facts, visuals, and proof points helps scratch that itch. I really enjoy facilitating the creation of solution diagrams for proposals because the exercise encourages a group to distill their subject matter knowledge and approach into an easily understood and appealing graphic. I write AWK scripts to parse financial reports to help me do my job, running a line of business, effectively and efficiently. But, it also scratches my algorithmic itch to aggregate and visualize lots of data. I index my email and other operational reports into a local full text search index because I know it should only take milliseconds to easily find data across various sources. I introduce Lean techniques into proposal development to quickly and efficiently extract approaches, win themes, and proof points from a cross-discipline group of experts. I still get very excited when one of my colleagues drops in and says "Come over. I want to show you something."<br /><br />While I've always known about my need to create, it was nice to read about a colleague who finds ways to scratch that itch while he progresses through his career and farther from writing code. Reading the post also cemented my feeling that my drive to build and learn won't go away and I'll need to find appropriate ways to satisfy that drive to stay happy at work.<br /><br /><br />
