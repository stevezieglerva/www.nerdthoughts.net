One of the apps had an animation of the app icon unchecking the item each time! For a long time, I used Microsoft's OneNote and had a simple checkbox list note that worked really well ... until they upgraded it and made it slower with lots of screen <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jank&amp;defid=7854246">jank</a>. One app prevented use while it sync'd after each item update.</li><li><b><span style="color: #7f6000;">Order the list by store aisle with custom aisle names</span></b> - I need to be able to sort the list by the order of the aisles in the store and I want to be able name the aisle/category myself.</li></ul><div>So, I finally settled on the <a href="http://www.ourgroceries.com/overview">OurGroceries </a>for iOS that met all of the critical things above. They do all of them well and have a very fast in-store user experience. There's still a few things that I think could be improved like allowing separate categories per store. &nbsp;I also noticed early on that the companion website was not the prettiest or most modern. But, the Agilest in me reminded me that pretty and modern weren't part of my critical needs. &nbsp;I'm sure they appropriately focused on the app experience over the website experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://mentormate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ourgroceries.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://mentormate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ourgroceries.png" height="200" width="200" /></a></div></div><div><br /></div><div>I'm still working towards the nirvana of having my wife use it also with a shared, synchronized list. But, I don't think OurGroceries provides change management consulting.</div><div><br /></div>
