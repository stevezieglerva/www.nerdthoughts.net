<div>At work, we're in the middle of a coding challenge as part of a government procurement. It's a great exercise in design, UX, and development. The official challenge is to do something with data from&nbsp;<a href="https://open.fda.gov/">https://open.fda.gov</a>. The unofficial challenge is to go from idea generation to working code in 10 days. It raised a running discussion with the team about how much<a href="http://www.nerdthoughts.net/2015/04/code-first-or-design-first-yes-as-soon.html?m=1"> to design before coding</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://open.fda.gov/"><img alt="open.fda.gov API" border="0" height="175" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ABq8jPx__H0/VY6MA-hXM0I/AAAAAAAAhGM/IuqARTjaT1Q/s400/open.fda.gov.png" title="open.fda.gov API" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /></div><div>These days, I'm mostly a pointy-haired boss. But, on this team, I'm acting as a Deliver Manager and a data person doing some actual scripting. I had a frustrating moment when trying to pull some data that reminded me of the value of coding early. I had planned to use the API to pull some unique data and load it into Elasticsearch. I was confident it would be easy because I'd done similar things many times before. It wasn't until I started that I realized some arbitrary API limits and throttling made it much more difficult than I had planned.<br /><br /></div><div>This all occurred with having the developer (me) in all of the discussions and decisions. I estimated two hours to do the work. Four hours into it, I had only accomplished 25% of what I wanted to and was left with doubts about the approach. Luckily, we had designed and coded just enough to find these gotchas and further iterations proved that the approach was solid.<br /><br /></div><div>It's got me thinking about how important <i><b><span style="color: #b45f06;">User Testing</span></b></i> is to UX specialists before making too many design decisions with the team. <span style="color: #b45f06;"><b><i>Approach Testing</i></b> </span>(algorithm, data, tech stack, mobile use) should be just as important to the team before making too many design decisions. It's the same thing as Code First, vertical slices, iterating, Fail Fast. But,&nbsp;<b style="color: #b45f06;"><i>Approach Testing</i></b><span style="color: #b45f06;">&nbsp;</span>feels more relatable when working in a heavy UX environment.<br /><br /></div><div><br /></div>
