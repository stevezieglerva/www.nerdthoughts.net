# Elasticsearch: From open-source to $5B
Elasticsearch went public on Friday.

It's been really cool seeing the company evolve. I'm a huge fan of Elasticsearch. I started using it when porting an process to index my email from Solr. Compared to Solr, I really liked the more RESTful API using JSON. I also really like how every field was dynamic by default. It make it so easy to just throw data into it.
