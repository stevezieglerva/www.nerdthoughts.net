Sandy Mamoli tweeted this yesterday:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">A user story is a conversation starter. A requirement is a conversation killer.<br />— Sandy Mamoli (@smamol) <a href="https://twitter.com/smamol/statuses/437307819407450113">February 22, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>I absolutely love this tweet:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>• <b><span style="color: #bf9000;">It's a great summary of Agile philosophies.</span></b> Constant conversations about needs, priorities, and quality are essential to delivering software that meets needs.<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>• <b><span style="color: #bf9000;">It reminds me of Humphrey's Law</span></b> that users really don't know what they want until they see working software (maybe not even then).<br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>• <span style="color: #bf9000;"><b>I hate the word "requirement."</b></span> It has such an authoritative and definitive connotation. &nbsp;It assumes that you can completely understand what you want well before any software is built. It also assumes every need has equal priority and equal value. I have a running joke every time I hear the story of a large Federal IT project that fails. I like to find out how many requirements they had or how many pages the specification document was. I proclaim that if only they had doubled or tripled the requirements or pages, then the project would have been a success! &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Sandy's not sure where she heard it, but I'm glad she shared it.<br /><div><br /></div><br /><br />
