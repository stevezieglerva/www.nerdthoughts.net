<i>*** Update 8/15/15</i> - I've got to downgrade my original review of the Jabra TOUR. My main reason for purchasing it years ago was for its dual-device capability. Now, I have just one new phone and it keeps dropping my audio while on calls. On just about every call, I can hear the other person, but they stop hearing me after a few minutes.<br /><br /><br />I got the Jabra TOUR at Costco during a $20 off promotion. I wanted an in-car  Bluetooth speaker that would handle phone calls from my Blackberry and  play music from iPod. I've been very happy with how easy it was to set  up and capability to pair two devices to it. Well worth the cost!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Jabra-TOUR.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Jabra-TOUR.jpg" height="244" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />
