<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://Picture of generic Neighborhood"><img alt="Picture of generic Neighborhood" border="0" height="213" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3780/9394736640_f7b196260d.jpg" title="Picture of generic Neighborhood" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />I've had a growing feeling that so many of the great ideas used in Agile for brainstorming, team communication, collaboration, and consensus building can be used outside of software development.&nbsp; I think they are a natural fit for the consulting world. Even just the values of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> apply outside of software. Now, I realize many Lean and Kanban ideas originated from manufacturing and outside of software.&nbsp; But, they seem to be rarely used in typical consulting, especially in Federal contracting (my world). <br /><br />I came across this great post about <a href="http://adaptivecollaboration.com/2013/07/19/passionate-agile-governance-for-hoas/">Passionate Agile Governance for HOAs</a> by Andrea Chiou (<a href="https://twitter.com/andreachiou">@andreachiou)</a>. It's a great example of applying Agile techniques outside of software. HOAs are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowner_association">homeowner associations</a> that are formalized groups of homeowners in a neighborhood.&nbsp; For established neighborhoods, they are used to collect fees, pay for community services (trash pickup, landscaping, ...), enforce the community rules, and make significant decisions on behalf of the community.&nbsp; HOA meetings can be tension-filled given the personal nature of homeownership and strong personalities. HOA board membership can really be a thankless job.<br /><br />Andrea implemented several Agile collaboration practices to help turn around a contentious atmosphere.&nbsp; Here's what she did, in her words:<br /><ul><li>Check-in : I let everyone say a few words about how they were feeling.</li></ul><ul><li>Facilitation: I ditched the dysfunctional Robert’s Rules protocol  that past meetings used which had caused friction. Not everyone had had a  voice. Many had felt it was unsafe to speak and stayed quiet. Others  had raised voices and interrupted each other with frequency.</li></ul><ul><li>Expectations: I created meeting rules (active listening, cell phones  away, no interrupting) and an agenda with Kanban post its. I moved  topics throughout the meeting. The ‘discussing’ column allowed one Topic  In Progress (TIP). Latecomers could see what had been covered and what  was left in a glance at the wall.  I wrote action items next to the  Completed topics, if there were any.</li></ul><ul><li>Timebox: I kept the meeting on target. We’ve had 2.5 or 3 hour meetings in past years. We finished in 1.5 hours.</li></ul><ul><li>Venue: I changed the venue to just give us a new perspective: We used  to hold them at a home, and there was drinking and food and banter. I  did it at the local library. It worked just fine. Some complained, but  most loved it. I wanted people to FEEL something different. Sometimes  you have to change space to do that.</li></ul><ul><li>Closing: I let people choose from three options:  Appreciations, 3 words to describe the meeting, or Pass.</li></ul>&nbsp;Do you think you could these techniques, outside of software, in your organization?<br /><br /><br />
