<div><br /></div><div>I created a simple game to add a little excitement to the<a href="http://www.kaskeykids.com/"> Kaskey Kids</a> Hockey Guys and Football Guys. It randomly picks the name of a play (like "Pass 30 yards", "Touchdown ", "Goal", "Goalie save"), shows a picture, and plays a crowd cheer or boo. I had the idea watching my kids play with the toys and see that they just didn't want to set them up. They wanted some game play.<br /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wJnQciVN46k/VokcS_GCYkI/AAAAAAAAhLs/3_t7A3JAjjo/s640/blogger-image-579293470.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wJnQciVN46k/VokcS_GCYkI/AAAAAAAAhLs/3_t7A3JAjjo/s320/blogger-image-579293470.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5f2_ZJ4zKpk/VokvZXw1-AI/AAAAAAAAhME/6rzulyIX11o/s1600/2015-12-25%2B20.30.07.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5f2_ZJ4zKpk/VokvZXw1-AI/AAAAAAAAhME/6rzulyIX11o/s320/2015-12-25%2B20.30.07.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /></div><div><br /><h3><span style="color: #7f6000;">MVP Release</span><span style="color: #783f04;">&nbsp;</span></h3>Knowing how fickle kids' interest can be, I focused on an MVP first so that I could see if it was worthwhile without spending a lot of time on it.<br /><br />I started with a spreadsheet that generated a random number and then picked a play and yard distance. I wanted it to take 15 mins to build so I could designed something that was pure formulas and didn't require any coding. Excel recalculates random numbers when you make any update to the spreadsheet. So, the kids could easily type any key, hit Enter, and see a new play.<br /><br />The game play needed to be kid friendly which meant lots of positive plays and scoring and just 4 downs to score instead of 10 yards for a first down. These were lessons learned from backyard games.<br /><br />I then copied the spreadsheet for hockey plays. I could have tried to make the formulas reusable in the same spreadsheet but didn't want to take the time to think about code or test it, especially since I was building while it while constantly being kid-questioned. It reminded of recent agile advice I've heard not to code for reuse initially. Coding for reuse really makes the code complex. Keeping it simple allows you to solve the use case you have today and add reuse cases later through refactoring once you have good test coverage.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg/782px-Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="25" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg/782px-Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg.png" width="25" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18457172/Random%20Football%20Play.xlsx">Random Football Play.xlsx</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg/782px-Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="25" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg/782px-Microsoft_Excel_2013_logo.svg.png" width="25" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18457172/Random%20Hockey%20Play.xlsx">Random Hockey Play.xlsx</a></div><br /><br />The spreadsheet was well received. It was cool to see how easy it was for them to use. But, I could tell though that my non-reader was having a little trouble distinguishing plays.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XdEp7UPfRVs/Vok1Jan9MhI/AAAAAAAAhMc/lSH5r19rOmA/s1600/2015-12-25%2B19.05.05.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XdEp7UPfRVs/Vok1Jan9MhI/AAAAAAAAhMc/lSH5r19rOmA/s320/2015-12-25%2B19.05.05.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><h3><span style="color: #7f6000;">Release 1.0</span></h3>So, I decided to make a more sophisticated game with images and sounds. Playing sounds didn't seem to be a necessary feature need but I figured the kids would get a kick out of it. For this version, I didn't want to spend more than a few hours coding. I also was going to do it at night when they were in bed since I would need to concentrate.<br /><br />This is where I really wish I could code mobile apps. This game idea is perfect for a phone or tablet that they can keep right next to the table game. But, since I was strapped for time, I choose a .NET Windows form app. To keep it simple, I stored images and sound files in 10 subdirectories named after the plays. This let me swap plays, images, and sounds at run time (convention over configuration). I also avoided any annoying data parsing of text or JSON files. The app shows the first JPG it sees and then plays all WAV files it finds.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v5jyuvtDThw/VppLkW19l7I/AAAAAAAAhMw/Ny8clF53mcc/s1600/football.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="241" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v5jyuvtDThw/VppLkW19l7I/AAAAAAAAhMw/Ny8clF53mcc/s320/football.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_b4mPbZsnac/VppLkZlXtpI/AAAAAAAAhM4/ohatY2rzIqk/s1600/hockey.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_b4mPbZsnac/VppLkZlXtpI/AAAAAAAAhM4/ohatY2rzIqk/s320/hockey.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The kids really enjoyed this version. The younger was able to understand the play images much better than the words. It was really popular the day it was released. But interest really waned after that. I had a feeling that this would happen and it was a driving motivation to limit my time investment.<br /><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18457172/Football%20and%20Hockey%20Bins.zip">Download the games</a><br /><br /><h3><span style="color: #7f6000;">Lessons Learned</span></h3>- Young kids don't get random. They would complain when the same play appeared<br />- You make better MVP and scope decisions when it's <b>your </b>time or money being spent<br />- Know when the market changes in you and stop investing in a losing product<br />- Avoid temptation to add features. I wanted to add a game clock, concepts to handle two players, and track 4 downs to score in football. All of these would have been wasted effort given the lack of interest.<br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
