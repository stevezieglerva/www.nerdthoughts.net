In the early 2000s, I worked on a large project to replace a set of mainframe systems with my company's fancy new client-server application. It was a great learning experience implementing an enterprise system for a huge, global company. I worked with some <a href="http://www.nerdthoughts.net/2014/05/from-picture-of-sweden-to-my-toughest.html?q=sweden">great clients</a>, especially the older COBOL programmers of the legacy systems.<br /><br />They had a great quote about building systems that has always stuck with me:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #bf9000; font-size: large;"><b>"We can only build the 3rd best system. We can't afford the best system and we won't know the 2nd best system until we build it."</b></span></blockquote>I love the sense that of hindsight that the quote implies. No matter how much planning and good execution you put into building something, you can always to it better the next time.<br /><br /><br />
