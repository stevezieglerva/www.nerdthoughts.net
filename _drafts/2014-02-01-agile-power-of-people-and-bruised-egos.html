<span style="color: red; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>My Awesome Idea: &nbsp;1 vote (1%)</b></span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Other ideas: 99 votes (99%)</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span>This week, I was reminded of how Agile democratizes teams. I'm helping on a corporate initiative around Agile and we took a vote on which tool to use. &nbsp;I thought to myself <b><span style="color: #b45f06;">"What a great idea!"</span></b> After I voted, I realized just about everyone else voted on a different tool and I thought to myself <b><span style="color: #b45f06;">"What about MY idea???"</span></b>&nbsp;It was enlightening exercise to see the opinions of my peers. It ended up being a great exercise because I got to learn a new tool and I saw how experts use it in a real context.<br /><br />It also got me thinking about how we're trying Lean Coffee on several of our team meetings. I clearly remember how one of my awesome, obviously important topics, only got one vote: mine. It was clear the team wanted to discuss other items that we're more important to them.<br /><br />Tough lessons for a former Command and Control PM, but all for the better of the team and project.
