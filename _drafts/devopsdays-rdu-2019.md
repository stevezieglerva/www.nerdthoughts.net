title: DevOpsDay Raleigh 2019
description: Take-aways from the conference
---

I attended the 2019 DevOpsDays Raleigh and really enjoyed it. There were lots of great sessions. Here are my take-aways and highlights from my favorite talks. The live-stream video of talks is on the [DevOpsDays Raleigh Y](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Xs0UbAdDaMRmStzhSsSag)


## General Thoughts
- Don't forget culture during your transformation
- Don't focus on finding a *single* root cause for an incident. There's rarely a single event.
- Lots of talk about the huge learning opportunities from failures.
- VPs don't get much respect as these events. Lots of jokes at our expense. :) 

	 
	 

## [Know Your Numbers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18-OFq--aD-4dswf73zuY-ngWGlP5LQib) by Anne Hungate

I had seen Anne preview this talk at the local meetup but really enjoyed it a second time. 

Here's what I liked:

- Her list of the reasons why companies execute projects
- "Right people working on the right projects at the right time."
    - Best people should be working on the most important projects.
- Her belief that like the retail apocolypse, there is a digital apoloclypse for companies not ready to move fast with DevOps.

## [Expand Your DevOps Practice](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qkMp7U8IKXWtWSHiwMhVyvY1c_VpBmne) by Marguerite Bryan

I attended this workshop without really knowing what it was about. 

Here's what I liked:
- DevOps is about culture and lean processes as much as technology
- A fast DevOps approach and pipeline will be useless if ideas/projects are approved on an annual budgeting cycle and a Change Control Board meets quartlerly
- The We Believe hypothesis template. I've seen this before in design thinking workshops and it was nice to see someone else recommend it. This is a great simple way to plan a test of a hyptohesis. 

```
We believe that: [doing this]
for: [target users/people]
will achieve: [this outcome]
We’ll know this is true when:
[this condition]
```

```
We believe that offering $25 gift cards to sign up new free-tier customers
for existing customers
will achieve an increase in sales of the premium subscription service.

We'll know this is true when 25% of the new customers have purchased the premium service.
```


## [Avoiding the Infamous DevOps Team!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xKHChHBRYo5jM1adWgTOjk9usuyo23H9) by John Esser

This talk focused on when to bring any separate innovative DevOps teams back into the main business engine of standard work. I think some people focused too much on the somewhat controversial topic of what *not* to name the team.

Here's what I liked:
- His stories of early DevOps conferences
- The advice to not let innovation teams exist separately for too long before being brought back into the main business engine.


## [Just Enough Feature Flagging](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m6pSIkTsifA5SaABbWhDGCCEQ7qf_zK8) by Dave Rogers

Here's what I liked:
- Very interactice session with the Story Time breaks to discuss deployment issues and feature flags with your seat neighbor
- Last few slides summarizing common mistakes and good ideas




## [DevSecOps: How to level up your organization’s security expertise](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19JNUB4xAL3RCmacNQdALot0dFGeAvu69) by Ann Marie Fred
This was the start of a series of security-focused talks. I enjoyed all of them, but this was my favorite.

Here's what I liked:
- Great summary slide of tradition IT security vs. DevOps security. 
- Focus on active hacks vs. theorectical hacks! 
- IBM open-sourced their [npm_audit_fixer](https://github.com/IBM/npm_audit_fixer) tool
