The focus is usually on delivering value and quality. But, making/saving money is typically at the heart of every client project. Being profitable has got to be a primary driver for every company.&nbsp; Without profits, you can't have raises, training, investments in products, or marketing. <br><br>In my experience, money is the driving project constraint.&nbsp; It determines:<br><br><ul><li>what kind of solution you can suggest in the proposal</li><li>who can work on the project</li><li>who can be staffed on the project</li><li>what kind of solution you can build during the project </li></ul>This is especially true on government contracting projects where you have very specific labor categories and billing rates that determine profitability.&nbsp;<br><br>I have a feeling that one reason for the lack of money discussion is that Agile projects have stable, fully-dedicated teams. If the team makeup stays the same and they work 100% on this project, you can look at the recent burn rate and just project forward each month (like <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2012/10/25/henrikkniberg/agile-product-ownership-in-a-nutshell">"yesterday's weather"</a>).<br><br>But, in my world, there can be several reasons for significant downtime on projects. You could have a formal deliverable waiting for review to authorize work on the next stage.&nbsp; You could be given a Stop Work order because the client is facing external budget issues outside of your project. Or, your illustrious legislative branch may force <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/01/what_is_sequestration_the_budget_cuts_will_slam_government_spending_yet.html">5%+ cuts across the board</a> on March 1st.<br><br>So, I've starting using Burn Up charts whose X-axis is money spent (revenue if you want to sound fancy). I think it can be just as important of a management tool as a traditional schedule-based Burn Up chart.<br><br>For example, let's say your project has a budget of $250,000 and deadline of May 15 (a period of performance written into the contract and not easily changed). Let's say it's April 1st and you've already delivered 19 items. The client really wants the last 11 items for a total of 30. If you consult your trusty Burn Up chart (based on schedule), you can see it'll be tight, but you can probably deliver the 30 items by May 15th.&nbsp; That's the salesman in me: just round up from 29 :)<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ny1iraYVR90/USoOIVd9NFI/AAAAAAAAgnY/C6gVY8q9-Js/s1600/burn-up-schedule.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ny1iraYVR90/USoOIVd9NFI/AAAAAAAAgnY/C6gVY8q9-Js/s1600/burn-up-schedule.png"></a></div>But, if you look at a Budget Burn Up, you can see that you're in trouble. You've spent $225,000 of the $250,000 budget delivering the first 19 items. At your typical pace, you'll only be able to deliver 23 of the 30 total items that the client wanted. <br><br><br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QDascTc4dM0/USoO4M_LxII/AAAAAAAAgno/2FPkECVELvU/s1600/burn-up-budget.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QDascTc4dM0/USoO4M_LxII/AAAAAAAAgno/2FPkECVELvU/s1600/burn-up-budget.png"></a></div><br><br>So, what do you now?&nbsp; Good question! That's part of being a Project Manager. You'll have to strike the right balance of client negotiations and consider reducing profit to cover the remaining costs. It's all a matter of contract restrictions, client relationships, and the financial health of your company.<br><br>Hopefully, your use of Agile and Kanban has ensured that you've delivered great value to the client to make the situation easier to deal with.<br><br>
