One of my New Years resolutions for 2012 was to stop taking paper notes.&nbsp; Little did I know that it would be so easy with Microsoft's OneNote 2010.&nbsp; I had started playing around with EverNote, but stopped when I heard <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> mention he liked the free flowing content placement better.&nbsp; Another big selling point was Microsoft's OneNote iOS app.<br /><br />My goal was to be able to do more than type live notes. I'm an extreme visual thinker so I needed to be able to draw and annotate images in real-time also. I quickly realized that I needed a custom ribbon combining my most-used items from the Home, Insert, and Draw ribbons.<br /><br />So, here is my customized ribbon. It highlights the:<br /><br /><ul><li>Select and Type</li><li>Custom Tags</li><li>Insert Space </li><li>Screen Clipping</li><li>Drawing</li><li>Table </li><li>and Zoom items</li></ul><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lM0ZXJ-U_qA/UdEJBwS-GxI/AAAAAAAAgqU/NA438VX8kJQ/s1426/OneNote+Toolbar.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Picture of my custom OneNote ribbon combining the items listed above" border="0" height="226" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lM0ZXJ-U_qA/UdEJBwS-GxI/AAAAAAAAgqU/NA438VX8kJQ/s640/OneNote+Toolbar.png" title="" width="640" /></a></div><br />
