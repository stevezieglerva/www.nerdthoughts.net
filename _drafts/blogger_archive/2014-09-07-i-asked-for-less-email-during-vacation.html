Sorry for the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Heres10ThingsIDidBeforeIWroteThisBlogPostTitleWhatHappenedNextWillShockYou.aspx">link bait</a>, but I'm addicted to them now. In August, I took a week of vacation and warned co-workers that I would not be checking email. On days off, I often read email, especially if I'm in town or there is a lot of proposal activity. &nbsp;But, for that vacation week, I was completely disconnected from work. Here's the request I sent to just my ICF colleagues (clients and spammers received no warning, just my OOTO email response):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #bf9000;">"Just a reminder that I’ll be on vacation next week and not checking emails. This year, I’ve averaged 66 emails per calendar day.&nbsp; Please consider leaving me off of CC’d emails since I expect to have 450+ emails when I return.&nbsp; If it’s important, we can catch up with a call when I return.&nbsp; Thanks. :) "</span></blockquote>So, when I returned, what did I find? &nbsp;A 55% reduction in email that week. Instead of my typical 66 emails per day, I averaged 29. &nbsp;Here's the breakdown of emails the week before and during vacation:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8xNWKQE4xW8/VA0h8MsAkUI/AAAAAAAAg68/5VvOuAWXlyo/s1600/emails_before_during.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Emails per day before and during vacation show drastic drop during vacation" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8xNWKQE4xW8/VA0h8MsAkUI/AAAAAAAAg68/5VvOuAWXlyo/s1600/emails_before_during.png" height="296" title="" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />I was curious if just my normal heavy emailers sent less, so I also counted the emails by sender importance. &nbsp;I've implemented a variation of Scott Hanselman's <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheThreeMostImportantOutlookRulesForProcessingMail.aspx">Three Most Important Outlook Rules For Processing Mail</a>&nbsp;so it's easy for me to see what types of people were sending me email:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lu5maGzINPI/VA0jkCu5XEI/AAAAAAAAg7M/iTWnCWv19kE/s1600/email_sender_importance.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Showing emails per day by sender importance shows that important and less important people sent less" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lu5maGzINPI/VA0jkCu5XEI/AAAAAAAAg7M/iTWnCWv19kE/s1600/email_sender_importance.png" height="408" title="" width="640" /></a></div><br />People in my Important and Less Important (primary audience for my request for less email) groups both sent less. &nbsp;Those in my Junk category continued their normal, relentless emails.<br /><br />Then, I was curious if this drop was significant. &nbsp;It felt like lot a less email than normal, but I wasn't sure. I index my email in Elasticsearch and visualize it in Kibana. &nbsp;So, I can easily get lots of stats on my email. I counted the number of emails per day for all of 2014 and then created a 7-day moving average to smooth out the weekend dips. I also added control band lines for the average and one standard deviation above and below. Just with a quick glance, you can see that the dip in August is dramatic. It drops almost a standard deviation in the week. &nbsp;But, you'll also see that my email volume has some pretty wide variations. I'm sure there's a statistical way to determine if the vacation drop was significant, but for now, I'll trust my eyes that my email request did reduce my email volume.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ewGQJkfflpc/VA0kcLCF10I/AAAAAAAAg7U/91_7GgB-F24/s1600/emails_moving_average.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ewGQJkfflpc/VA0kcLCF10I/AAAAAAAAg7U/91_7GgB-F24/s1600/emails_moving_average.png" height="200" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />So, what happened the week <i>after</i> my vacation? My colleagues came back with a vengeance (especially that first Monday) and I averaged 77 emails per day!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AogJjoMj2Q4/VA0h8MVDqNI/AAAAAAAAg64/75ufqcTPYdk/s1600/emails_before_during_after.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="email volume returned to greater than average volumes once I returned from vaction" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AogJjoMj2Q4/VA0h8MVDqNI/AAAAAAAAg64/75ufqcTPYdk/s1600/emails_before_during_after.png" height="296" title="" width="640" /></a></div><br />While I'll never be able to fully stem the email tide, grouping my email into buckets of importance definitely helps wading through them. &nbsp;It took me a lot less time to get through my 212 vacation emails than I expected, especially since 20% of my junk email (including junk work email) was filtered out.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div>
