It's a key part of leadership and your own career advancement.<br /><br />When I think of giving credit, I think of how a seasoned quarterback gives a press conference after a game. If the team lost, the quarterback takes the blame for his bad throws and poor timing. But, if they win, a good quarterback follow this standard script:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #b45f06;">The O-line gave me time.<br />The running back opened up the passing game.<br />The receivers made great catches<br />And, the defense kept us in the game.</span></blockquote></div><div>It's a great way to handle credit and blame. It's a technique that every leader, even our QB here in Washington, needs learn and practice. <br /><br /><br /></div>
