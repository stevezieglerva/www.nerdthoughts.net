<br />I recently logged a bug for GSA's <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/">18F blog website</a>. I noticed on my RSS reader, Feedly, that the URL in the RSS title was incorrect. It actually duplicated the domain name. It seemed like a simple issue to fix so I decided to try to log it.<br /><br />Like all 18F work, the website code is hosted in a GitHub repo and has a publicly available Issues page. I poked around at the source code wondering if I could find where the error occurred. I was going to reference the source code and suggest a possible fix to save them time, but the RSS file and properties seemed to be generated externally. So, I just logged the bug (<a href="https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/issues/1497">issue 1497</a>) and waited to see what happened.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5JAqp4oUGP0/VuVkW24WG-I/AAAAAAAAhNo/0KgGbU0p8PwmQ8Ul3wBxSdsYSLVjoe5WQ/s1600/github_screenshot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" height="278" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5JAqp4oUGP0/VuVkW24WG-I/AAAAAAAAhNo/0KgGbU0p8PwmQ8Ul3wBxSdsYSLVjoe5WQ/s400/github_screenshot.png" title="picture of the Github issue" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Within an hour, a developer chimed in suggesting a possible source of the bug. The bug was fixed and the new site deployed to prod the next day. It was a really cool experience and led me to several observations:<br /><br /><ul><li><b><span style="color: #b45f06;">I expected 18F to respond quickly</span></b> - Even just a few years ago, I never would have bothered to try to report an issue on a government website. I wouldn't have found an easy way to report the issue and doubt it would have gotten fixed anyways. But, in this case, I expected 18F to respond quickly. They have the processes, development tools, and streamlined website in which they have the ability to respond quickly. I also assumed they would appreciate public comment on their site given their focus on transparency.</li><li><b><span style="color: #b45f06;">There are real people behind the website</span></b> - One cool thing I didn't expect was the personal aspect of the process. Given the use of GitHub, I could see real people discussing the issue and fixing it in real time. I felt very connected to the process, even as a complete outsider.</li><li><span style="color: #b45f06;"><b>Participating is believing</b></span> - I've been following 18F since their inception. While I've read numerous posts on their belief in transparency, it didn't really sink in until I participated in the process. While I know this was a simple fix on just a blog site, it's still a huge advancement in the way government treats IT.</li></ul><br /><br /><br />
