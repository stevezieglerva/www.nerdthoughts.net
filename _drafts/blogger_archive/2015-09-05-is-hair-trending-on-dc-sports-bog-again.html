The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/">DC Sports Bog</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/dcsportsbog">Dan Steinberg</a>&nbsp;has a really unique take on DC sports. I guess you'd have to have a unique take after living with Dan Snyder's ownership for the last 16 years. He takes a snarky, cynical view of the teams, their owners, and media relations. <br /><div><br /></div><div>I've been exploring classifiers for unstructured text and decided to try one out on the blog. I'm looking for a simple classifier that won't required a big effort in developing training data for learning. I downloaded all of the posts from 2014 and tried to classify posts into a few categories that any reader of the blog will recognize:</div><div><ul><li><span style="color: #b45f06;">Injury - Big topic these days with RG3's non-concussion (verbal)/concussion (written)</span></li><li><span style="color: #b45f06;">Broadcaster - Dan talks a lot about local sports broadcasters</span></li><li><span style="color: #b45f06;">Hair - Facial, head, and chest</span></li><li><span style="color: #b45f06;">Losing - I was curious how much losing was talked about, especially given some crushing playoff losses recently</span></li><li><span style="color: #b45f06;">Owners - Seems like posts about Dan Snyder write themselves</span></li><li><span style="color: #b45f06;">Politics - You can't be in DC without writing about politicians talking about the local teams</span></li></ul><div>Instead of just searching and counting individual words in the text, I used term frequencies against a corpus of typical blog posts to extract keywords. This allowed me to determine what the post was about. I then searched these keywords for specified words related to a category:</div><div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span style="color: #b45f06;">hair|Is about: haircut, hair, beard, mustache, goatee</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span style="color: #b45f06;">injury|Is about: injuries, injury, hurt</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span style="color: #b45f06;">losing|Is about: losing, loss</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span style="color: #b45f06;">broadcasters|Is about: dianna russini, dan hellie, britt mchenry, dave owens, kristen berset, tim brant, lindsay czarniak</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span style="color: #b45f06;">owners|Is about: daniel snyder, dan snyder, ted leonsis</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span style="color: #b45f06;">politics|Is about: congressman, senator , governor, president obama, vice president biden, george bush, barrack obama, joe biden, hillary clinton, bill clinton, muriel bowser, marion barry, harry reid, nancy pelosi, john boehner</span></span></li></ul></div></div><div>The rules for the categories aren't perfect, but they do give you a quick way to get decent classification of the text.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I then created some small multiples to show the references for the categories over time. As I expected, there are a lot of posts about the owners. Surprisingly though, there seem to be more posts about Leonsis, than Snyder. &nbsp;Maybe it's because Ted owns two local teams. &nbsp;I was not surprised to see the constant flow of posts about hair. Dan loves a good beard or 'stashe.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uwoBW5xDeWE/VePKheEYWHI/AAAAAAAAhJQ/uXMhdZFwY7g/s1600/DC%2BSports%2BBog.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="268" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uwoBW5xDeWE/VePKheEYWHI/AAAAAAAAhJQ/uXMhdZFwY7g/s640/DC%2BSports%2BBog.png" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div></div>
