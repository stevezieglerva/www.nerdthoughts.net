I am a huge fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29">Kanban</a>.&nbsp; One of the biggest reasons is that applying Kanban to your current processes is not hard or disruptive.&nbsp; You just visualize what you are currently doing.&nbsp; As the folks at <a href="http://www.crisp.se/gratis-material-och-guider/kanban">Crisp </a>say:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #b45f06;">In Kanban you start with whatever process you have, visualize it, introduce WIP limits, and then evolve from there.</span></blockquote><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html"><img border="0" height="392" src="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/images/kanban_board.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>&nbsp;Awesome visual from <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/jeff_patton.html">Jeff Patton</a><br /><br />Your visualization can be as simple as a board with To Do, Doing, and Done lanes. The most disruptive part is introducing the Work In Progress (WIP) limits.&nbsp; I know this is blasphemous to say, but I think you can hold off on introducing WIP for a while.&nbsp; Just the visualization and continuous improvement will pay off for an organization used to waterfall.&nbsp; <br /><br />It's best summarized in a quote that I read on Twitter.&nbsp; It's killing me that I can't find it now and attribute the credit but here is what I remember:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #b45f06;">You don't do Kanban.&nbsp; You apply Kanban to your current processes.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><br /></blockquote>
