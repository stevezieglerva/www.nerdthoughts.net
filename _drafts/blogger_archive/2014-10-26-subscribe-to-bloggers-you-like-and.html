Filed under: Stating the obvious<br /><br />I still haven't found a great way to bookmark Twitter links for future reading. &nbsp;I've found effective ways to favorite, email, or put them into a Google doc. The breakdown is usually in the finding time to actually read them. I ran into this again recently when Kin Lane posted two items (on the same day) whose titles easily grabbed my attention:&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/10/25/cutting-back-on-my-traveling-and-speaking/">Cutting Back On My Traveling And Speaking</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/10/25/clarification-on-the-cease-and-desist-i-got-from-pluralsight/">Clarification On The Cease And Desist I Got From @Pluralsight</a>. &nbsp;I'm usually checking Twitter in short bursts of dead time which is not ideal for reading posts.<br /><br />But, I do find when I open up Feedly, my RSS reader, it is at a time when I can read a full post and appreciate it. I added him to my reader and was pleasantly surprised at seeing some of the headline/images (stuff I totally missed from just following him on Twitter).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1qH_2kycF4s/VE0_eGxolgI/AAAAAAAAg-A/AmptLlGGums/s1600/kinlane.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1qH_2kycF4s/VE0_eGxolgI/AAAAAAAAg-A/AmptLlGGums/s1600/kinlane.png" height="247" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I saw several posts with images of the Veterans Administration (VA) seal that caught my eye.

It's tough to read that an agency&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration_scandal_of_2014">with obvious issues</a>&nbsp;can't consistently and easily use technology and bright minds to help our vets.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So, if you can't keep up with the Twitter firehose, at least switch the noozle to mist by adding people you like and respect to your reader.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.blackgold.bz/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gilmer-mist-web-300x225.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://www.blackgold.bz/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gilmer-mist-web-300x225.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Source:&nbsp;http://blackgold.bz/start-seeds-indoors-5-of-6-proper-watering-of-indoor-seedlings/</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><br />
