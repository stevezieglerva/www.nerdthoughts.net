<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, the digital services group of GSA, recently posed a question on their blog: <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/04/03/18f-discussion-should-project-teams-code-first-or-design-first/">Should Project Teams Code First Or Design First?</a>&nbsp;It was a good discussion with a designer and a developer that concluded regardless of the approach, the focus should be on the end users and their needs. One of my favorite parts of the post was that they didn't ask "Should reams of requirements documents be written first?"<br /><br />My take on the post was that design and code are equally important and the sooner you do a little of both, the better. It also got me thinking about how I've seen the pros/cons of doing one or the other first.<br /><br /><h4><span style="color: #b45f06;">Coding First - You might lose the forest for the trees</span></h4>My first use of Agile on projects was Kanban, not the traditional Scrum methodology often associated with government IT projects. I chose Kanban for an existing project because it is easily adapted to an <a href="http://www.nerdthoughts.net/2013/01/why-i-love-kanban-instant-fit-to-your.html?q=kanban">existing process</a> and I was worried about too much change disrupting the team.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Simple Kanban board with To Do, Doing, and Done lanes" border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg" height="190" title="Simple Kanban board with To Do, Doing, and Done lanes" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg">Simple Kanban Board</a> by <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jeff.lasovski&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Jeff.lasovski</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />We created a really complex board, that matched the complex process of content creation, development, quality control, and deployment. It quickly solved many of our QA and communication issues. The board and process had a large focus on coding first.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AIQ6htyKm9Y/VR_Wcn0Vk7I/AAAAAAAAhCc/mjN8qWSIbjk/s1600/Complex%2BKanban%2BBoard.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Complex Kanban Board" border="0" height="260" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AIQ6htyKm9Y/VR_Wcn0Vk7I/AAAAAAAAhCc/mjN8qWSIbjk/s1600/Complex%2BKanban%2BBoard.png" title="Complex Kanban Board" width="640" /></a></div><br />But, in the first retrospective, the team complained that they've lost site of the big picture given the discrete nature of the cards and process steps. Also, the benefit of a continuous flow of work had the downside of not having a chance to pause and reflect. So, we introduced a regular monthly meeting to step back, look at the big picture, and do some broader design.<br /><h4><span style="color: #b45f06;">Design First - You might design the impossible and users just don't know what they want</span></h4><div>On another project, we used Scrum to help build a GIS tool with a new web mapping technology. Not only was the technology new to the team, but it was a newer, evolving product. We had a basic idea of what the technology could do, but did not have many details.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the early sprints, we did the typical UX steps of wireframes, user testing, and design comps. In parallel, we were researching the technology trying to figure out what functionality was exposed through their API.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BG9uvGEpkQ4/VSKo1z2DAYI/AAAAAAAAhC0/YCIv3yGj84E/s1600/c40_wireframe.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Black and white wireframe" border="0" height="275" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BG9uvGEpkQ4/VSKo1z2DAYI/AAAAAAAAhC0/YCIv3yGj84E/s1600/c40_wireframe.png" title="Black and white wireframe" width="320" /></a></div><div><span style="color: #b45f06;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zMZLyUTETgU/VSKpSE0-YmI/AAAAAAAAhDE/7bHyKR07gPw/s1600/c40%2Bdesign.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Design comp" border="0" height="310" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zMZLyUTETgU/VSKpSE0-YmI/AAAAAAAAhDE/7bHyKR07gPw/s1600/c40%2Bdesign.png" title="Design comp" width="320" /></a></div><div><span style="color: #b45f06;"><br /></span></div><div>After we had created the initial design artifacts, we realized that we needed to prove what was possible with the technology. In the next sprint, we had a task focused on trying out a vertical slice of the solution. A vertical slice is a set of functionality that hits each of the major pieces of the stack. This is different than many UX-focused prototypes that have a heavy focus on the front-end. Like many agile topics, it's nicely illustrated in a visual by Henrik Kniberg:</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m4TvQYKYVBM/VSKxp-3iLiI/AAAAAAAAhDo/6s6AiJ-loeI/s1600/20130820-What-is-Agile.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Vertical slice of a solution" border="0" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m4TvQYKYVBM/VSKxp-3iLiI/AAAAAAAAhDo/6s6AiJ-loeI/s1600/20130820-What-is-Agile.png" title="Vertical slice of a solution" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2013/08/21/henrikkniberg/agile-event-major-swedish-bank">What is&nbsp;Agile</a><a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2013/08/21/henrikkniberg/agile-event-major-swedish-bank">?</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg">Henrik Kniberg</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>We built a throwaway prototype of some of the basic functionality to convince ourselves that we were going down the right path and that everything was possible technically. Since this was a technical prototype to validate the stack, we didn't make it look pretty.

We quickly learned that much of what we planned was duplicated by an existing tool, hard to build with the API, or didn't work given the existing documentation. So, we pivoted our solution and built something (still using the new technology) that complimented existing tools and fit within schedule and budget.<br /><br />Another possible drawback to too much early design before coding is that often, users really don't know what they want until they use it on a live system. It's Humphrey's Law: the user will never know what they want until after the system is in production (maybe not even then). Wireframes, paper prototypes, and design comps are nice, but, the sooner you can also code and test on a working system the better.<br /><br />
