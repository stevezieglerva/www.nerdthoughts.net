<a href="http://wall-skills.com/">Wall-Skills.com</a> is a project by <a href="http://finding-marbles.com/">Corinna Baldauf</a> and <a href="http://liquidat.wordpress.com/">Roland Wolters</a>&nbsp;to help spread Agile knowledge by creating simple one-pagers that you can hang around your office. People will run into the posters and get a little science dropped on them.<br /><br />They are very well done and cross a wide range of topics. &nbsp;I suggested the <a href="http://wall-skills.com/2013/cumulative-flow-diagram/">Cumulative Flow Diagram</a> and gave a few review comments. I think it turned out great.<br /><br />Thanks to Corinna and Roland for putting it together and adding to great online resources to spread Agile.<br /><br />PS. I know they did this months ago around the holidays, but I'm just getting to it now!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
