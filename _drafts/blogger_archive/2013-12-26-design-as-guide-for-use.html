<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I'm a big fan of design especially how it can be used for aesthetics, functionality, and marketing. I'm frequently impressed with the design of kids toys and how they use design to add realism and make the toys intuitive to use. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">My 2 year old got a replacement set of binoculars whose design really guides the child into using them correctly. &nbsp;If you have young kids, you've probably seen them pick up binoculars incorrectly and hold them backwards. &nbsp;Here are some pictures of our binoculars:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><h3><span style="color: #b45f06;">Confusing Design - Happy Giddy Binoculars</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OB3i4L5D-P0/UrxLKaCOZmI/AAAAAAAAg0w/0DPGS0p_R5k/s1600/NiceCanon_2264.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OB3i4L5D-P0/UrxLKaCOZmI/AAAAAAAAg0w/0DPGS0p_R5k/s320/NiceCanon_2264.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div>The <a href="http://www.melissaanddoug.com/happy-giddy-binoculars">Happy Giddy Binoculars</a>&nbsp;are designed for young kids but both our kids held them backwards. Obviously, this is not really a problem when pretending with your kids. But, having seen other toy binoculars, I can see some design mistakes. You place the orange notched ends near your eyes. As an adult, the eye piece looks realistic but young kids can't really differentiate between the orange and green ends. I think a bigger size difference between the ends would also help, but that would have to be proven through usability testing. :)&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It has a playful caterpillar designed to look outward which is a natural concept for adults. But, I think kids are tempted to look at the caterpillar's face and turn the binoculars backwards.</div><div><br /></div><h3><span style="color: #b45f06;">Well Designed - GeoSafari Jr Kinoculars</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v73ebsZvipU/UrxLKLHn8VI/AAAAAAAAg0s/LJtZCP1O_bw/s1600/NiceCanon_2265.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v73ebsZvipU/UrxLKLHn8VI/AAAAAAAAg0s/LJtZCP1O_bw/s320/NiceCanon_2265.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div>The <a href="http://www.educationalinsights.com/product/geosafari--174-+jr.+kidnoculars--8482-.do?sortby=bestSellers&amp;sortby=&amp;">GeoSafari Jr. Kincoulars</a>&nbsp;was specifically designed to guide kids to hold it correctly. The eye piece is surrounded by a guard molded for a face. It naturally follows the curve of the face and our boy intuitively places this end near his eyes. It also has a cutout for the nose that prevents him from holding it upside down.</div><div><br /></div><h3><span style="color: #b45f06;">For Older Kids - Fisher Price Kid-Tough Binoculars</span><span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</span></h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BRn7FlmYFhc/UrxLKJ9UBlI/AAAAAAAAg00/W2Q4umByRyQ/s1600/NiceCanon_2266.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BRn7FlmYFhc/UrxLKJ9UBlI/AAAAAAAAg00/W2Q4umByRyQ/s320/NiceCanon_2266.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">My 5 year old received the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-R3932-Kid-Tough-Binoculars/dp/B002SXMH44">Fisher Price Kid-Tough Binoculars</a>&nbsp;as a gift from his cousin. He easily held them correctly which is probably more of a function of his age. But, I think the color and size differences in the ends help. These binoculars are marketed as really durable and got a good endorsement from my sister. We'll put them to use outside and see.</div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
