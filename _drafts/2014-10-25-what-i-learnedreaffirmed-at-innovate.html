<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://innovatevirginia.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/innovate14_arrows.png?w=350&amp;h=104" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="95" src="https://innovatevirginia.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/innovate14_arrows.png?w=350&amp;h=104" width="320" /></a></div><br />I attended my second <a href="http://innovatevirginia.com/">InnoVAte Virginia</a> today and really enjoyed it. &nbsp;It's put on by <a href="http://www.agilerichmond.com/">Agile Richmond</a>&nbsp;and, like last year, had a great mix of agile, UX, analysis and assurance, and devops.<br /><br />I really debated going. &nbsp;I've been in proposal hell for the last few weeks and wasn't looking for a early morning drive down for it. But, they always get a great set of speakers and this year they had Jeff Patton (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeffpatton">@jeffpatton</a>). I'm very glad I went. It's refreshing to hear new ideas, especially outside of the bubble of federal consulting. It was nice to meet a few new folks from ICF also. I hope the conference keeps up the wide variety of topics including good topics for newbies. I'd like to bring more folks down next year to learn new ways of developing, managing, collaborating, and thinking.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0tiYk9IgAAdrv8.jpg:large" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0tiYk9IgAAdrv8.jpg:large" width="180" /></a></div><br /><br />So here are the major things I learned/re-affirmed:<br /><br /><ul><li><b><span style="color: #7f6000;">Little things make a big difference</span></b> in Agile development, waterfall development, collaboration, and just problem solving in general. Jeff Patton gave an awesome presentation on some little, but very effective and impactful things to help groups gain common understanding and then act on it. I had assumed he'd be talking about story mapping but was so glad he gave this presentation. He had a big focus on "Show Me" using drawings, walls, whiteboards, and post-its. I love his pictures from Atlassian offices that showed that Jira is for tracking, not thinking. It looks like everyone tweeted his "shared documents are not shared understanding." He had a really interesting discussion on appropriate group sizes and I loved his "Uninvite Someone" to get to a 3-4 person group size for decision making. It was great to see Jeff in person. His post on <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html">Kanban</a> started my Agile journey several years ago and gave me the courage to finally try it.</li></ul><ul><li><b><span style="color: #7f6000;">Think about the principles behind the Agile Manifesto</span></b> when worrying that you're not being Agile. Richard Cheng (<a href="https://twitter.com/RichardKCheng">@RichardKCheng</a>) led an interactive discussion on "Are we being Agile?" He brought up typical issues that Agile projects encounter and used the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principles </a>to determine if the team's solutions were agile. I frequently find myself wondering if tweaks to the norms will improve our teams. I liked how Richard was flexible and open to tweaks, as along as is it still met the spirit of the principles. &nbsp;It reminds me of when a wise (well, at least old) Australian once told me "Don't follow the dogma. It's never 100% &nbsp;right and never 100% &nbsp;applicable to all contexts."</li></ul><ul><li><b><span style="color: #7f6000;">Gotta get me some DevOps.</span></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan Shriver (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshriver">@ryanshriver</a>) and Dave Tashner (<a href="https://twitter.com/DaveTashner">@DaveTashner</a>) gave a great presentation on DevOps. I really enjoyed the slides that listed terms, activities, and processes along the Development and Operations gradient. The benefits of CI and good DevOps integration is obvious. We just need to find a way to take baby steps and and get over the Us vs. Them organization barriers.</li></ul><ul><li><b><span style="color: #7f6000;">A good amount of PT Barnum can nail a pitch</span></b>. Given that I work in a Marketing and IT organization and do business development as a large part of my job, I can really appreciate good marketing and a great pitch. The singlestone guys gave a great demo. First, their session title "DevOps Demystified" got me hooked. Second, they planned to do a live demo that spun up a VPN, builder server, web server, database server, and compiled web app from a Github repo during the session. &nbsp;Anyone who has done live demos knows how risky that can be. They jokingly played that up and kicked off the process with a single API call and warned it would take 11 mins. &nbsp;They continued the presentation and turned back to the app once it was up. They showed off an impressive Chef server to orchestrate the AWS setups and AppDynamics server monitoring. Then, they stole the show by unveiling the running web app which invited people to text their name to a specific number. As people texted, their names appeared on the app. To make it even more interactive, they built and deployed a new version with selfie support. When you texted a pic to the number, that picture appeared behind you name. While it was not the world's most complex website, it had enough razzle/dazzle and crowd interaction to impress everyone. Well played.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UqhZ_co0tIo/VEsimJJtWtI/AAAAAAAAg9w/lvmpULRsm-I/s1600/richmond-Brookland-20141024-00152.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UqhZ_co0tIo/VEsimJJtWtI/AAAAAAAAg9w/lvmpULRsm-I/s1600/richmond-Brookland-20141024-00152.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ppj_H6doHQ8/VEsil0LkgbI/AAAAAAAAg9o/xe_OtnXQxdQ/s1600/richmond-Brookland-20141024-00153.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ppj_H6doHQ8/VEsil0LkgbI/AAAAAAAAg9o/xe_OtnXQxdQ/s1600/richmond-Brookland-20141024-00153.jpg" height="241" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
