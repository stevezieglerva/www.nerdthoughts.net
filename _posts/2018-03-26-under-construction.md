I'm in the process of moving my blog from Bloger to a static site generated by Jekyll and served via an AWS S3 bucket. I got impatient and made the DNS switch last night while I'm still migrating the content. The automated conversion tool left a lot to be desired and still linked to assets in Blogger. So, I'll be manually converted old posts to markdown over time.
