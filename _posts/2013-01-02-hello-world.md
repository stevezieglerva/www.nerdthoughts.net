It was a goal to start a blog during my Christmas break so I'm getting in under the wire.&nbsp; I've been meaning to do it for a while but [Scott Hanselman's post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx) inspired me to finally do it. Of course Scott recommends getting my own server and domain but I don't have time for that.&nbsp; I've got a few topics mapped out and hope to post once a month.
